# PCA and SVD
## Goal of task
- implementation Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- comparison of PCA using eigen-value decomposition vs. SVD
- implementation of Moore-Penrose inverse using SVD

## PCA results
- these methods were applied on the Iris dataset, which is a collection of 150 iris flower samples of three related species (50 samples per species). For each sample four features have been measured.
- the transformed data is plotted, samples highlighted according to their class
- another plot shows how much variance can be explained

## Code files
- run_hw2.py (main) loads the Iris dataset
- utils.py this file was not created by the teaching assistants of the Data Mining 2 course
- pca.py implementation of PCA using SVD and eigen-value decomposition
- pinv.py implementation of Moore Penrose Pseudo Inverse

-HW_Lieberherr.pdf only page 3 and 6 are relevant and contain the ouput (plots)
