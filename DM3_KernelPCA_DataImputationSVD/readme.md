## SVD Imputation and Kernel PCA

## Goals of task
- computation of optimal rank-r approximation for data imputation of an image containing 60% missing values
- implementation of Kernel PCA using SVD

## Procedure to find optimal rank
A training set and test set were generated by using 70% of all non-missing values for training and the remaining 30% for testing.
A new training set is generated where all testing indices (30% of all entries) are set to nan. Iteratively, different rank r values were tested (from 1 to 30) by imputing the training matrix and computation of the mean squared error between the imputed testing points and the true testing points.
Finally, the optimal rank r (with the lowest mean square error) was used for imputation of the original image

## Kernel PCA
Is applied to the half-moon dataset.
The performance of normal PCA and RBF-Kernel PCA was compared to each other.
For RBF-Kernel PCA, different values for the hyperparameter gamma were tested.

## Code files
- run_HW3.py is the main file
- utils.py was created by the teaching assistants of the Data Mining 2 course
- pca.py contains the implementation of normal PCA and Kernel PCA
- impute.py performs the data imputation of the image
