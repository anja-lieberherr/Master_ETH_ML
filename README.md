# Selection of ML Coding experiences 
Here is a selection of Homework assignements/Projects of two different courses at ETH currently going on in the Spring Semester 2021.

## Introduction to Machine Learning (IML) course 
This course gives a wide overview into Machine Learning techniques:
- Linear regression (overfitting, cross-validation/bootstrap, model selection, regularization, [stochastic] gradient descent)
- Linear classification: Logistic regression (feature selection, sparsity, multi-class)
- Kernels and the kernel trick (Properties of kernels; applications to linear and logistic regression); k-nearest neighbor
- Neural networks (backpropagation, regularization, convolutional neural networks)
- Unsupervised learning (k-means, PCA, neural network autoencoders)
- The statistical perspective (regularization as prior; loss as likelihood; learning as MAP inference)
- Statistical decision theory (decision making based on statistical models and utility functions)
- Discriminative vs. generative modeling (benefits and challenges in modeling joint vy. conditional distributions)
- Bayes' classifiers (Naive Bayes, Gaussian Bayes; MLE)
- Bayesian approaches to unsupervised learning (Gaussian mixtures, EM)

### Projects in IML
The Project work in IML is a team work of 2 students. I collaborated with my fellow student for the following tasks.
- Task 1b
- Task 2
- Task 3

## Data Mining 2 (DM) course
This course presents advanced topics in data mining and its applications, it is about finding patterns and statistical dependencies in large databases, to gain an understanding of the underlying system from which the data were obtained.

- Dimensionality Reduction
- Association Rule Mining
- Text Mining
- Graph Mining

### Projects in DM2
The project work in DM2 is an individual work
- DM2_PCA_SVD
- DM2_KernelPCA_DataImputationSVD
